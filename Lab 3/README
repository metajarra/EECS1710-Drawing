This project is intended to simulate the behaviour of an isolated ant colony.

The centre of the colony is the HIVE QUEEN. 
The queen (displayed as a red square) has the following abilities:
- It can reproduce, creating new ants of different types (scout ants or gatherer ants). New hive queens cannot be created
- It can eat, consuming food stores when it reproduces
- It can "remember", with a memory capable of recalling every place it has found food before
- It can "think" (on a very rudimentary level), capable of deciding whether to create a new gatherer or scout ant depending on the circumstances

There are 2 other types of ANT, inhereting from the ant class. These are the SCOUT ANT and the GATHERER ANT.
The default ant class has the following abilities:
- It can move, travelling to a point outside of its immediate vicinity
- It can "remember", able to recall the point at which it was instantiated (the hive)
- It can recieve orders from the hive, giving it places to search for food

The scout ant (displayed as a white square) has the following abilities:
- It can search for food, with sensors directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of itself
- It can communicate with the hive, informing it that it has found food (and the position)

The gatherer ant (displayed as a yellow square) has the following abilities:
- It can "gather" food, travelling to a point where food was found and bringing it back to the hive
- It can communicate with the hive, informing it that it has finished the gathering operation

Food also exists in the world, distributed in randomized patterns. This food only exists to be green, and has no other abilities

The goal of this project is to simulate the exponential growth of an ant colony - the more gatherer ants are created, the higher the queen's ability to create new gatherer ants
